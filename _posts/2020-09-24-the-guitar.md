Ben was sweating uncomfortably in his suit. Having lugged his guitar for twenty minutes from the MRT on foot, he had just arrived at Harry’s, a small bar tucked away in a corner off Harding Street. As Ben walked through the front door, he nearly choked on the smell of cigarette smoke, and also the stuffy air only seemed to make his sweating worse. This was not his idea of a Friday night.

The bar had but a single room, gray and poorly-lit, with a small elevated stage in front of him and some rickety plastic stools cramped further behind. Squinting through the haze, he saw some familiar faces in the audience. Had they come to see him play tonight? No, it would be awful for him to be seen playing at places like this. But an eager hand shot up from the back row that he could not ignore. Ben returned the wave with a weak smile, and quickly averted his gaze.

Ethan was a student of his at a local music college. Just like him, Ethan was a big fan of music—they shared the same tastes, and admired the same idols. But he also admired Ben’s playing, and had now even followed him to Harry’s. Ben sighed. In many ways, Ethan reminded Ben of his younger self: idealistic and devoted to the craft, yet ignorant of the road that lay ahead.

If only Ethan knew what life was like, to be a middle aged man in your late 30’s, still single and living with your parents; to watch your friends climb up as bankers and executives, while stuck in a dead-end job; to struggle to make ends meet, despite working late-night shifts at seedy bars like Harry’s. After listening to the persuasions of his friends, Ben had over the years drawn up countless plans to switch careers, and yet somehow he could never find it within himself to quit.

Ben unpacked his guitar. It was a vintage 1952 Les Paul, a secondhand he bought decades ago from a dusty store in Brooklyn. He smiled. The sight of his guitar recalled memories of his youth: of practice sessions in music school, listening to his idols play in the streets of New York, and alcohol-infused jam sessions lasting through the night. Those were the days of dreams and fresh-faced wonder, but they were now long lost, his guitar the only remaining memento of a life he left behind.

Ben strapped on his guitar and stepped onto the stage. The lights brightened, suffusing the stage with a warm glow. As he played the first tune of the night, he began to settle into a familiar rhythm, and his anxieties melted away. The changes, the twists and turns in the tune, seemed to flow through his fingers and onto the fingerboard with a light and easy touch. Soon Ben and his guitar were an intimate duo, the player and instrument in perfect harmony.

One after another, inspired melodies were to come out of that guitar, each one met with cheers and shouts from the audience. But he could not hear them. He had become so absorbed, so in tune with his guitar, that music alone was his world now.

Tune after tune elapsed, and soon the set was over.

The lights dimmed, and Ben made his way down the stage. He could see Ethan approaching in the distance. Ben quietly packed his guitar and slipped out the front door, back to the business of living.
