You come home to find a giant bathtub sitting in the middle of your living room. It is generic white, made of porcelain; clear water fills it about a quarter of the way full. Submerged at the bottom is a large rubbery pad, with small holes in it spaced out in a regular grid; a cord extends out from its side to a blinking metal tower. Surrounding the bathtub in a circle are little plastic stools, whose tops are covered with scented candles and rock crystals of every colour. As you inhale, the thick smell of lavender invades your lungs; you promptly hold your breath. You look on, unsure whether to be horrified or impressed. Your mother had outdone herself this time. You feel like introducing the bathtub to a sledgehammer, but then you begin to wonder how much it had all cost.

The bathtub? That must be at least eight hundred. The lavender oil? One hundred. The crystals? That would be fifty each, for a total of five hundred. The machine? It looks sophisticated, probably the type to produce negative ions, so you tentatively put it at six hundred. You do some quick math, and arrive at a total of two thousand. That was how much you’d earned teaching tuition on weekends in the past six months.

You sigh, and put your backpack down. It falls to the floor with a heavy thud. You consider the pros and cons of entering another argument with her. Pro number one: she might be more likely to watch her spending in the future—just maybe. You spend some more time thinking, but fail to come up with pro number two. Con number one: you’d lose your temper. Con number two: you’d ruin the precious weekend you get to spend back at home with her. Con number three: you’d only be wasting your breath trying to change her mind.

You remember the huge argument you had a year ago. Your mother had replaced the water filter in the kitchen and installed a huge machine under the sink. It was to detoxify the water flowing through the pipes, she said. It had also cost thousands of dollars. That evening, she had sat you down at the kitchen table, pulled out a Chinese brochure, and eagerly explained its benefits: a lower blood pressure, balanced chi in the body, and increased alkalinity in the bloodstream.

You rolled your eyes, and began explaining to her how the bloodstream really worked. You told her about the bicarbonate buffer system, and how any excess alkalinity would be quickly neutralised by the reserves of carbonic acid in your blood. Any increase in pH, however slight, would only disrupt the body’s physiological functions and wreak havoc. It was all elementary biology, you said.

No matter, she scoffed, waving a hand in the air. Those were Western ideas. But this was Chinese medicine, and it worked its own wonders. Western doctors didn’t know everything, she said, giving you a wink. She loved to tell you that every time, to rub it in.

But this time she had pushed you over the edge. You stood up from your seat, clenching your fists, and lashed out at her in defense of your future profession. The two of you exchanged heated words, you in English and her in Mandarin, for the next half hour. Then the two of you wordlessly ate dinner together at the kitchen table, before you packed your bags and returned to your hostel for the night.

After that night, she would lay off on buying those gadgets for a while, perhaps keen to avoid your wrath. But a few months later, you would come home every weekend to see her collection of devices slowly grow once again, one by one; remembering the painful memory of your argument, you would only hold your tongue each time.

But this time was different. She had brought home a giant bathtub. In the living room.

You begin to question the decision you had made to stay in school all those months ago. It had come along with your scholarship, and so it was free of charge. But was it all right to leave your mother here, alone? Maybe that was why she kept watching all those Chinese TV shows all the time—she had little else to keep her company. But those shows peddled bad medical advice. Without you by her side, who would be there to correct her?

A sudden whirring noise coming from the metal tower snaps you back into the present. Moments later, the water in the bathtub begins to bubble loudly. Then a sharp but sweet tang hits your nose—that must be the ozone. You grumble, and reach for the power button on the machine. But then you hear a side door click.

“Jasmine, you’re back!”

You turn to see your mother, dressed in white robes and fluffy white slippers, a towel wrapped neatly around her hair. In her left hand, she carries a white mat; on her right, a little box full of bottles and scented oils.

“Look, I know what you’re going to say. But I did my research carefully, okay? This is the real deal.”

You stare at her, seeing her dressed in this strange attire for the very first time. Your jaw hangs loose.

“Nothing to say?”

Remarkably, you find no words coming to your lips.

“Okay, I’ll explain later. Just watch.”

Moving to the side of the bathtub, she lays out the mat neatly before her, and removes her slippers to stand on it. She sprinkles some salt above the water, and from each tinted bottle in turn she pours a few drops of oil. Then she clasps her hands and shuts her eyes, as if in prayer. You stand back and observe as she performs the ritual; you even grow a little afraid. Is she finally out of her mind? Or had she learned of some mystery, some secret forever beyond your grasp?

Slowly, she steps into the bathtub. She dips her feet into the bubbling water, and then lowers her body into it. You watch on without a word as she continues to slide herself down, sinking lower and lower into the bathtub, until you can see her face no longer.
