Hey there! I'm Zi Wei, and this is my website.
I'm currently a third-year undergraduate, and I enjoy reading, writing, and everything in between.

I'll reserve most of the space here for writing about technical-related topics,
but you might see something else on occasion too.

You can contact me at [hello@zwlim.com](hello@zwlim.com), or find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/halfwhole).
